Gabriel\n    Faerno (1500-1561) was an Italian writer who published fables in\n    Latin. Perrault translated these into French verse, and published\n    them at Paris in 1699.\n[5] _Rodilard_.--The name no doubt taken from the famous cat\n    Rodilardus (bacon-gnawer), in Rabelais, _Pantagruel_, IV., ch. LXVII.\n\nIV.--THE TWO BULLS AND THE FROG.[9]\n\n  Two bulls engaged in shocking battle,\n    Both for a certain heifer's sake,\n  And lordship over certain cattle,\n    A frog began to groan and quake.\n\n  One bull was beat, and much to their expense;\n  For, quick retreating to their reedy bower,\n  He trod on twenty of them in an hour.\n\n    Of little folks it oft has been the fate\n    To suffer for the follies of the great.\n\n[9] Phaedrus, I. 30.\n\n.ende\n\n"
